OPEN INTERVAL

1.computer selects a value (S)
2. variables AL and AH takes respective values of 1 and N
3. User inputs a guess value (G)
4. Computer verifies the conditions:
	if G = S, program outputs a message "that's right!"
	otherwise, if condition G < S is not satisfied: update variable AH with this new value G and take a the half of it for the next try out as we know the AL
	if condition G < S is not satisfied, update AH with this G value and take the median value between AL and AH.
	continue until G = S
