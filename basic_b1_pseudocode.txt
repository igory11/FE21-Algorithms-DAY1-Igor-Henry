CLOSED ARRAY 

1. input the value N to limit the array o the right hand-side
2. computer selects a number (S) in the given array
3. User inputs a value G 
4. computer applied the conditions to the guessed (G) number and compares iit with the selected (S) value:
	if G is equal to S, then the program outputs the right number. The game is ended

	if G is outside the array, the program messages: "number outside the interval. try again."
	if condition G < S is satisfied, the program messages: " G is too small" thereby helping the user for the next guess
	if condition G < S is not satisfied, the program messages: "G is too big" thereby helping the user for the next guess
